# KotlinMultiplatform
Learning KMM is challenge for me and feeling enthusiastic to complete a production app into that.

Kotlin has enjoyed an explosion in popularity ever since Google announced first-class support for the language on Android, and Spring Boot 2 offered Kotlin support.
I am android geek who mostly work on android task or challeges may be you guys from other background or platforms ex.JS or iOS Native or any other where you contributes more time in terms of working in your day today life.

Kotlin only runs on the **JVM**, but that’s no longer true. **Kotlin Multiplatform** is an experimental language feature that allows you to run Kotlin in JavaScript, iOS, and native desktop applications, to name but a few. And best of all, it’s possible to share code between all these targets, reducing the amount of time required for development.

If you’re unfamiliar with Kotlin generally, I’d recommend visiting the Kotlin website (kotlinlang.org).

I followed multiple internet resources(I know they are many) from where I am learning this:
